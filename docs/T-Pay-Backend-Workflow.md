## 1. Our job

We own `backend/`, `shared/`, and the API contract's server side. The backend is the only place that holds PayPal and AI secrets, issues certificates, captures funds, and declares a voucher settled. The [API contract](T-Pay-API-Contract.md) lists every activity and endpoint, and the [frontend workflow](T-Pay-Frontend-Workflow.md) shows how each one is used.

| We own | The frontend engineer owns |
| :--- | :--- |
| Payment rules and ports in `shared/` | Android adapters that implement those ports |
| API, authentication and validation | Calling the API from the listed activities |
| PayPal, webhooks, settlement and Payouts | PayPal approval screen and deep link return |
| Postgres, ledger and reconciliation | SQLite and offline records on the phone |
| Gemini and proposal validation | Voice capture, confirmation and playback |

**Out of scope:** new endpoints without a contract change, live PayPal mode, KYC, bank APIs, and budgeting or transit APIs before submission.

## 2. Stack

| Need | Use |
| :--- | :--- |
| Runtime | Node, TypeScript in strict mode, Express |
| Database | Render Postgres, accessed through repositories |
| Validation | Zod schemas in `backend/src/validation/`, typed against `shared/src/contracts/` |
| PayPal | REST: Orders v2, Payments v2, Webhooks, Payouts |
| AI | Gemini through `@google/genai`, behind `IAssistantModel` |
| Crypto | Node `crypto` for ECDSA P-256 behind the shared `ISigner` port; a small dependency-free JCS function in `shared/` with fixtures |
| Tests | Vitest, fast-check and Postman |
| Hosting | Render |

## 3. Folder structure

  jobs/                    release and retry jobs
  composition/             creates adapters and services
  server.ts
```

Existing `shared/src/escrow`, `shared/src/shared`, `shared/src/resource-tracking` and `shared/src/hybrid-assistant` code migrates as each ticket touches it. Browser adapters leave `shared/` in BE-03.

## 4. Clean code and SOLID rules

| Principle | What it means here |
| :--- | :--- |
| Single responsibility | A controller handles HTTP, a service runs one use case, a repository persists one aggregate, and an adapter talks to one system. |
| Open and closed | New webhook events map to handlers without rewriting the dispatcher. |
| Liskov substitution | A fake gateway and the PayPal adapter return the same failure classes. |
| Interface segregation | Split PayPal into focused ports such as `IPaymentAuthorizer`, `ICaptureGateway` and `IPayoutGateway`. |
| Dependency inversion | Services depend on ports. Only `src/composition/` creates concrete classes. |

| Clean code rule | Standard |
| :--- | :--- |
| Business rules | Never in controllers, routes or SQL strings. |
| `shared/` purity | No third-party dependency, framework, database, network or secret code. |
| Time and randomness | Always through `IClock` and `IRandom`. |
| Money | Integer minor units only. Convert only through the shared function. |
| Errors | Domain results map to contract error codes in one place. |
| Secrets | Environment variables only. Never in logs or responses. |
| Idempotency | Every mutating path is safe to retry. |
| Logs | Structured, with a correlation ID. No keys, tokens or personal data. |
| Tests | Write the failing test first for each money or security rule. |
| Comments | Explain why, not what. Delete unused code. |

## 5. Endpoint delivery map

The backend is complete for an activity only when the listed endpoint passes its tests and the frontend can use it.

| Endpoint | Activity | Controller | Service | PRD | Ticket |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `POST /devices/register` | ACT-02, ACT-01 renewal | `DeviceController.register` | `RegisterDevice` | FR-02, FR-36 | BE-05 |
| `POST /vaults` | ACT-04 | `VaultController.create` | `CreateVaultOrder` | FR-06 | BE-06 |
| `GET /paypal/return` | ACT-05 callback | `PayPalReturnController.handle` | None | FR-43 | BE-06 |
| `POST /vaults/{id}/authorize` | ACT-05 | `VaultController.authorize` | `AuthorizeVault` | FR-06, FR-37 | BE-06 |
| `GET /vaults/current` | ACT-03 | `VaultController.current` | `GetCurrentVault` | FR-08 | BE-06 |
| `POST /vouchers` | ACT-10 | `VoucherController.submit` | `SubmitVoucher` | FR-14, FR-18 | BE-08 |
| `GET /vouchers` | ACT-10 | `VoucherController.list` | `ListVouchers` | FR-22, FR-23 | BE-08 |
| `GET /vouchers/{id}` | ACT-11 | `VoucherController.get` | `GetVoucher` | FR-20 | BE-08 |
| `POST /vaults/{id}/melt` | ACT-12 | `VaultController.melt` | `MeltVault` | FR-09 | BE-07 |
| `GET /merchants/me/ledger` | ACT-13 | `MerchantController.ledger` | `GetMerchantLedger` | FR-40 | BE-09 |
| `POST /merchants/me/withdrawals` | ACT-14 | `MerchantController.withdraw` | `WithdrawToPayPal` | FR-41 | BE-10 |
| `POST /assistant/interpret` | ACT-15 | `AssistantController.interpret` | `InterpretRequest` | FR-32, FR-46 | BE-11 |
| `POST /webhooks/paypal` | PayPal | `PayPalWebhookController.handle` | `ApplyPayPalEvent` | FR-21 | BE-08 |
| `GET /health` | Operators | `HealthController.check` | `CheckHealth` | NFR-10 | BE-01 |
| `GET /profile` | ACT-16 | `ProfileController.get` | None | FR-02 | BE-05 |
| `PATCH /profile` | ACT-16 | `ProfileController.update` | None | FR-02 | BE-05 |
| `GET /transactions` | ACT-11 | `TransactionController.list` | `ListTransactions` | NFR-03 | BE-05 |

Offline activities ACT-01, ACT-06 to ACT-09, ACT-16 and ACT-17 have no endpoint. We support them through `shared/` rules and tests.

## 6. Data model

| Table | Key fields | Important constraint |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `devices` | `id`, `key_id`, `public_key`, `role`, `display_name`, `payout_email`, `revoked_at` | Unique `public_key` |
| `device_tokens` | `device_id`, `token_hash`, `created_at` | Store only a hash |
| `vaults` | `id`, `device_id`, `paypal_order_id`, `paypal_authorization_id`, amounts, `fx_rate`, `status`, `spend_by`, `settle_by` | One open vault per device |
| `vouchers` | `id`, `vault_id`, `sequence`, `payload_hash`, `payload`, `payee_key_id`, amounts, `status`, `paypal_capture_id` | Unique `vault_id, sequence` |
| `settlement_attempts` | `id`, `voucher_id`, `paypal_request_id`, `state`, `next_attempt_at` | One active attempt per voucher |
| `ledger_entries` | `id`, `merchant_device_id`, `type`, `amount_usd_minor`, `voucher_id`, `withdrawal_id` | Unique credit per voucher |
| `withdrawals` | `id`, `merchant_device_id`, `amount_usd_minor`, `paypal_batch_id`, `status` | Unique idempotency key |
| `paypal_events` | `event_id`, `event_type`, `payload`, `processed_at` | Unique `event_id` |
| `idempotency_keys` | `key`, `device_id`, `request_hash`, `response` | Unique `device_id, key` |
| `alerts` | `id`, `type`, `vault_id`, `voucher_id`, `details` | Used for conflicts and overspend |

## 7. Critical flows

### 7.1 Voucher settlement

1. Validate the request and authenticate the device.
2. Verify the vault certificate and voucher signature through `shared/`.
3. Confirm the device is the payer or payee.
4. Lock the vault row in a database transaction.
5. Look up the vault and sequence.
6. If the same payload exists, return the stored result with `replay: true`.
7. If different content exists, set `REJECTED_CONFLICT`, block the vault and raise an alert.
8. If capture would exceed the authorisation, set `REJECTED_OVERSPEND`, block the vault and raise an alert.
9. Store the voucher and settlement attempt, then capture through the gateway.
10. On success, store the capture ID, create the ledger credit, and set `SETTLED`.
11. On timeout or 5xx, read PayPal first, then either complete or schedule a retry.
12. On expired or declined authorisation, set `SETTLEMENT_BLOCKED`.

Captures on one vault are serialised. A retry never runs until a read-back proves that no capture exists.

### 7.2 Vault close

1. `POST /vaults/{id}/melt` stops new vault activity.
2. Verify the spend statement.
3. If all declared vouchers are settled, release the hold now.
4. Otherwise, return the blocking vouchers and schedule release at `settleBy`.
5. A job releases remaining funds after `settleBy` and sets `CLOSED`.

Release uses a void when nothing has been captured. If captures exist, use the method proven by the PayPal sandbox test.

### 7.3 Assistant

1. Accept only `text` or audio.
2. Send a bounded instruction and the language to Gemini.
3. Validate the response against the proposal schema.
4. Reject amounts above the supplied capacity for payment intents.
5. Log the proposal and validation result, without secrets.
6. Return a proposal. Never sign or call payment services.

## 8. Tickets

Each ticket needs a branch, a pull request, tests, and the activity or endpoint in its title.

| Ticket | Work | Depends on | Target |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| BE-01 | Add `LICENSE`, fix the `userId` error, enable `strict`, add Vitest, real health check and Render blueprint | None | 4–5 Nov |
| BE-02 | Publish `shared/src/contracts/` and all ports from the contract | None | 5 Nov |
| BE-03 | Fix `Money`, add clock and random ports, move browser adapters out of `shared/`, add attack tests | BE-01 | 5 Nov |
| BE-04 | Implement voucher, certificate, sequence, payment request and receipt rules with fixtures | BE-02, BE-03 | 5–6 Nov |
| BE-05 | Postgres setup, device registration, tokens, certificates and auth middleware | BE-01, BE-04 | 6 Nov |
| BE-06 | PayPal sandbox proof, vault creation, return page, authorisation and current vault endpoints | BE-05 | 6–7 Nov |
| BE-07 | Melt, spend statement, release job and hold rules | BE-06 | 7 Nov |
| BE-08 | Voucher submission, settlement, retries, conflict handling, webhooks and list endpoints | BE-06 | 8 Nov |
| BE-09 | Merchant ledger endpoint | BE-08 | 9 Nov |
| BE-10 | Payouts endpoint, only if the sandbox proof passes | BE-09 | 9 Nov |
| BE-11 | Gemini interpret endpoint and prompt-injection tests | BE-02 | 9 Nov |
| BE-12 | Concurrency tests, Postman collection, logs and README setup | BE-08 | 10 Nov |
| BE-13 | Final Render deployment, sandbox data, judge instructions and submission support | All P0 | 10–11 Nov |

## 9. Required tests

| Area | Must prove |
| :--- | :--- |
| Money | No floats, negatives or infinite values enter money rules. |
| Signing | A fixture verifies, and any changed field fails. |
| Certificates | Wrong root, wrong device and expired certificates fail. |
| Replay | Lower sequence arriving later still settles; exact replay makes no second capture. |
| Conflict | Same sequence with different content blocks the vault. |
| Overspend | Total captures never exceed the authorisation. |
| Concurrency | 100 duplicate submissions create one capture. |
| PayPal failures | Timeout, 429, 5xx, expired and declined paths reach the right state. |
| Webhooks | Replay changes nothing, and bad signatures are refused. |
| Melt | Early melt never releases funds needed by an issued voucher. |
| Assistant | Invalid and over-limit model responses never create a proposal. |
| Secrets | No secret appears in responses, logs or the app bundle. |

## 10. Definition of done

A ticket is done only when:

1. It maps to an activity or a listed external endpoint.
2. Failing tests came first for money and security rules.
3. The response matches the contract types and error codes.
4. Mutating paths are authenticated and idempotent.
5. Domain and application code has no Express, Postgres, PayPal SDK, or platform imports.
6. Typecheck and tests pass.
7. Logs contain no secrets or personal data.
8. The endpoint is deployed or has a clear handover note.
9. A teammate reviewed the pull request.

## 11. Working with the frontend

| Topic | Rule |
| :--- | :--- |
| Daily sync | Share what merged, what is deployed, and what is blocked. |
| Contract first | Publish types before endpoints so the frontend can build against them. |
| Handover | Each endpoint gets a Postman example and any sandbox setup. |
| Breaking changes | Change the contract first, with both owners approving. |
| Branch names | `feature/be-08-act-10-settlement` |
| Commit messages | Short, imperative, and tied to one purpose |
