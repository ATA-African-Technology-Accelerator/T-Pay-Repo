## 🌍 1. The Reality: The African Blackout Crisis

In Nigeria and across sub-Saharan Africa, over **40% of digital point-of-sale transactions fail during grid outages and cellular network blackouts**. 

- **Merchant Reality**: Informal market traders (e.g. Mama Nkechi) juggle 3 to 5 clunky bank POS terminals hoping at least one has signal. When networks collapse, commerce reverts to unrecorded cash or stalls entirely.
- **Literacy Barrier**: Millions of market sellers cannot read or write spreadsheet formulas, making traditional accounting apps useless.
- **Double-Spend Fraud**: Existing "offline payment" attempts fail because unscrupulous actors double-spend their offline balances before syncing.

**T-Pay solves this with a dual-engine breakthrough**:
1. **The Time-Locked Market Vault ("The Budget-Locked Vault")**: Cryptographic pre-authorization on PayPal servers that completely eliminates offline double-spending.
2. **On-Device Hybrid Voice AI**: Natural speech recognition and audio readout in **Nigerian Pidgin, Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, and English** that automates inventory deduction and physical cash audits without touching a spreadsheet.

### 1. The Time-Locked Market Vault ("The Big Gun")
- **Online Pre-Funding**: While connected, the user pre-authorizes an offline shopping budget (e.g., ₦10,000 for 5 or 24 hours). PayPal's cloud places a cryptographic pre-auth hold on the user's balance.
- **Zero Double-Spend**: Because the funds are locked on PayPal's servers, the user cannot spend that money elsewhere while offline. Every offline spend produces an HMAC-SHA256 voucher verified against the pre-auth.
- **Opportunistic Clearinghouse**: Whichever peer reconnects to the internet first transmits the cryptogram to PayPal APIs for settlement.
- **Auto-Melt Guarantee**: When the timer expires, any unspent funds automatically dissolve back into the user's primary PayPal checking account.

### 2. Zero-Literacy Hybrid Voice AI
- Runs locally offline via **Mobile SLM (Small Language Model)** with online Gemini cloud fallback.
- Native dialect comprehension for **Nigerian Pidgin, Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, and English**.
- **Spoken Audio Readout**: Closes the literacy gap by speaking confirmations, inventory levels, and reconciliation summaries aloud so informal traders never need to read a screen.

### 3. The 3 Specification Demo Personas
- **Case 1: Mama Nkechi Provisions (Market Trader)**
  - Natural voice sale: *"Collect 1k for coke"*.
  - AI calculates price-to-quantity: ₦1,000 ÷ ₦500 unit price = auto-deducts 2 bottles from stock and logs ₦1,000 cash.
  - Spoken inventory sheet setup: *"Coke, 42 packs, 500 naira for 1; Maltina, 56 packs, 600 for 1"*.
  - Interactive **End-of-Day Physical Stock Audit & Cash Reconciliation** modal with spoken review.
- **Case 2: Salary Earner (Personal Budgeting)**
  - Budgets for Food (₦60k), Transport (₦30k), and Upkeep (₦40k).
  - *"Send 2k for spag"* auto-categorizes under Food budget with a note.
  - Conversational ambiguity resolution: *"Send 5k for sneakers"* prompts the user: *"Does this fall under Food, Transport, or Upkeep?"* with 1-tap classification.
- **Case 3: Morufu Transport (7-Seater Korope Mini-Bus)**
  - Driver announces *"Collect money from everybody"*.
  - Proximity Bluetooth BLE mesh sweeps all passenger devices.
  - Audio alert to driver: *"5 passengers have paid. You have 2 seats left."*

## 🏗️ 3. Clean Architecture & Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

The codebase strictly adheres to DDD Clean Architecture in [`core/`](./core/):

```
core/
├── banking/              # BankAccount Aggregate, Balance Value Object
├── escrow/               # Time-Locked Market Vault & Offline Escrow Tokens
│   ├── domain/           # MarketVault Aggregate Root, Domain Events
│   ├── application/      # LockMarketVaultUseCase, MeltMarketVaultUseCase
│   └── infrastructure/   # LocalStorage & PayPal Gateway Adapters
├── resource-tracking/    # Smart Resource Tracking
│   ├── merchant/         # InventoryItem Aggregate, Price-to-Quantity derivation
│   ├── budget/           # MonthlyBudget Aggregate, Ambiguity Resolver
│   └── transit/          # KoropeTrip Aggregate (7-Seater Manifest)
├── assistant/            # Hybrid SLM NLP Parser, Speech Synthesis Adapter
└── __tests__/            # Verification suite (9/9 domain tests passing)
```

To run the architectural domain verification suite:
```bash
node --loader ./ts-loader.mjs core/__tests__/domain-verification.ts
```
